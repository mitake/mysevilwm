/* You can specify the initial state of the windows in this file
 *
 * Synopsis:
 *
 *  WIN(name, index, x, y, w, h, vdesk, focused, mark, winid)
 *   name:    The name of window
 *   index:   The index of window
 *   x:       Initial position of the window
 *   y:       Initial position of the window
 *   w:       Initial window width
 *   h:       Initial window height
 *   vdesk:   Initial vdesk for the window
 *   focused: Unused
 *   mark:    Initial mark
 *   winid:   Window ID
 *
 * When a new window is initialized, an unique number will be
 * allocated for each name as index. The index starts from zero.
 * Following is an example scenario:
 *  1. start xterm A (name="XTerm", index=0)
 *  2. start xterm B (name="XTerm", index=1)
 *  3. start emacs   (name="Emacs", index=0)
 *  4. finish xterm A
 *  5. start xterm A (name="XTerm", index=0) (the index 0 is allocated
 * again)
 *
 * Typically, you can create this file from running sevilwm by
 *
 *  % sevilwm
 *  % # create windows and arrange their positions as you like
 *  % ruby unixclient.rb /tmp/sevilwm_$DISPLAY/windows > config_win.def
 *  % make clean all  # rebuild sevilwm
 *  % # shutdown sevilwm
 *  % sudo cp sevilwm /usr/local/bin
 *  % sevilwm
